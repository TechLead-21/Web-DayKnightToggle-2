# Web-DayKnightToggle-2
🌚🌞 A Toggle between Day and Night mode using a framework called Darkmode.js

👤 Darkmode.Js

🌓 Add a dark-mode / night-mode to your website in a few seconds

This library uses the css mix-blend-mode in order to bring Dark-mode to any of your websites. Just copy paste the snippet and you will get a widget to turn on and off the dark-mode. You can also use it without the widget programmatically. The plugin is lightweight, built in VanillaJS. It also uses localstorage by default so your last setting will be remembered !


🚩 How To Use
Easy way (using the JSDelivr CDN)
Just add this code to your html page:

<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/darkmode-js@1.3.4/lib/darkmode-js.min.js"></script>

<script>
  new Darkmode().showWidget();
</script>
